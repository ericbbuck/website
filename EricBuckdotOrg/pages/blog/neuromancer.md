snippet: Thoughts on Neuromancer, Gibson

Finishing Necromancer by William Gibson was a strange experience. I felt a rare urge to re-read the book immediately upon its completion. About 70% of the way through some clarity on the plot and characters began to dawn on me. This sense of understanding grew to a timely crescendo with the end of the book. This gave rise to the thought that a second read would be ingested completely differently.

The best part of the novel, I found, was Gibson's slow drip feed of information to the reader. The narration style is respectful of the reader's intelligence. Gibson manages to craft finely detailed world through showing, not telling. 

The story follows Case - a washed up cyber-cowboy looking for a fix however he can get it. At heart, it is a heist story following a rag-tag crew of troubled professionals. The journey of Case, Molly the cold-blooded Razor girl, Talcum the Rastafarian Zionite, and Riviera the heroin addicted holo-thrower makes Ocean's 11 feel like a stroll through the park.

I liked the gentle way the book touched on the concept of free will. The oppressive mega corporations and governing bodies teem in the background throughout the story. We watch as the world sucks the free-will from these characters, and as it slowly dawns on them that the manipulation is inescapable. 

And finally, Gibson's absolutely poetic description of "cyberspace": 

"Case's consciousness divided like beads of mercury, arcing above an endless beach the color of the dark silver clouds. His vision was spherical, as though a single retina lined the inner surface of a globe that contained all things"
